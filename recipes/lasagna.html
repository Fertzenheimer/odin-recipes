            When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes 
            more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would 
            become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's 
            Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has 
            ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for 
            two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 
            53 years old — read all about his life and legacy here.

            The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's 
            incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient 
            list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original
             recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to 
             your grocery list:
· Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean 
ground beef.· Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked 
with the meat to add tons of flavor.
· Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato 
sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
· Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the 
flavor of the sauce.
· Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley,
 dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
· Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
· Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra 
decadent.
· Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when 
you cut into it.
