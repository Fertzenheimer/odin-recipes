        As far as I'm concerned, a simple gratin is the most 
        delicious way to cook fresh scallops. The only real way to
         screw this recipe up would be to use the wrong scallops. 
         And by wrong, I mean any scallops that have been soaked in
          a preservative brine. These are easy to identify, as they're
           usually sitting in a pool of milky liquid. What you want are 
           usually sold as wild 'day-boat,' 'diver,' or 'dry-pack' 
           scallops. They are really expensive, and worth every penny.
            Serve with French bread for dipping.

    <h2 class="italic">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup creme fraiche</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>8 dry-pack sea scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="italic">Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Brush 2 
            small gratin dishes with 1 tablespoon melted butter.</li>
        <li>Whisk creme fraiche, white wine, lemon zest, cayenne pepper,
             and kosher salt together in a bowl until sauce is smooth. 
             Place scallops in sauce and toss to coat; let sit until 
             flavors begin to blend, about 5 minutes. Divide scallops 
             between prepared gratin dishes and pour remaining creme 
             fraiche sauce over the top. Top with tarragon and Parmesan
              cheese. Drizzle remaining butter over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 4 minutes. Increase oven 
            setting to broil and continue cooking until scallops are 
            golden brown, slightly springy, and opaque, 2 to 4 minutes
             more.</li>
     </ol>
